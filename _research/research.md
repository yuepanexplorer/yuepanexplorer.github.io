Before I start grad school, I sampled many fields of astrophysics. I put an emphasis on studying
<a href="https://esahubble.org/wordbank/dwarf-galaxy/#:~:text=Dwarf%20galaxies%20are%20small%20galaxies,Way%20or%20the%20Andromeda%20Galaxy.">dwarf galaxies</a> one of the oldest, most dark-matter dominated, and chemically primitive stellar systems in the universe - because I was intrigued by their power to challenge
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model">Î›CDM</a> paradigm and UChicago (where I did my undergrad) happens to have many experts in this field. Below are three research projects related to this subject:

How do dwarf galaxies quench?

I worked with <a href="https://astro.uchicago.edu/~andrey/">Prof. Andrey Kravtsov</a> and Dr. Christine Simpson on using the state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical
simulation <a href="https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/auriga/Auriga ">Auriga</a> to probe how dwarf galaxies quench (or, shut down their star formation) in simulations
across different mass scales. We found that low-mass dwarf galaxies are primarily quenched by the UV ionizing photons from the 
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/astronomy/epoch_reionization.pdf">epoch of reionization</a>, intermediate-mass dwarf galaxies are primarily 
quenched by environmental processes such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_pressure">ram-pressure stripping</a>, and high-mass dwarf galaxies 
are mostly still star-forming since their gravitational potential is large enough to resist stripping and early-universe quenching processes. We compare our simulation
results with several observations (Satellies Around Galactic Analogs, <a href="https://sagasurvey.org/">SAGA</a>; 
the Exploration of Local VolumE Satellites survey, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00014">ELVES</a>) and found that they are consistent. 
See details in my paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13805">here</a>). 

How can we more efficiently identify more member stars of dwarf galaxies in observations?
