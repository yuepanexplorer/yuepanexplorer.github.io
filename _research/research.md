Before I start grad school, I sampled many fields of astrophysics. I put an emphasis on studying ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_galaxy#:~:text=Ultra%2Dfaint%20dwarf%20galaxies,-Ultra%2Dfaint%20dwarf&text=Unlike%20GCs%2C%20UFDs%20contain%20a,dark%20matter%2Ddominated%20systems%20known.">UFDs</a>) - one of the oldest, most dark-matter dominated, and chemically primitive stellar systems in the universe - because I was intrigued by their power to challenge
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model">ΛCDM</a> paradigm and UChicago (where I did my undergrad) happens to have many experts in this field. Below are three questions I tried to answer in my three research projects about dwarf galaxies. 

How do dwarf galaxies quench?
---

I worked with Prof. <a href="https://astro.uchicago.edu/~andrey/">Andrey Kravtsov</a> and Dr. Christine Simpson on using the state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical
simulation <a href="https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/auriga/Auriga ">Auriga</a> to probe how dwarf galaxies quench (or, shut down their star formation) in simulations
across different mass scales. We found that low-mass dwarf galaxies are primarily quenched by the UV ionizing photons from the 
<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/astronomy/epoch_reionization.pdf">epoch of reionization</a>, intermediate-mass dwarf galaxies are primarily 
quenched by environmental processes such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_pressure">ram-pressure stripping</a>, and high-mass dwarf galaxies 
are mostly still star-forming since their gravitational potential is large enough to resist stripping and early-universe quenching processes. We compare our simulation
results with several observations (Satellies Around Galactic Analogs, <a href="https://sagasurvey.org/">SAGA</a>; 
the Exploration of Local VolumE Satellites survey, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00014">ELVES</a>) and found that they are consistent. 
See details in my paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13805">here</a>). 

How can we more efficiently identify member stars of UFDs in observations?
---
Upon finishing the project above, I started to wonder how do observers deal with these extremely faint and low-mass UFDs in their surveys. What surveys and techniques do we
need to study the resolved stellar population of Milky-Way (MW) UFDs? I worked with Prof. 
<a href="https://kadrlica.github.io/">Alex Drlica-Wagner</a>, Prof. <a href="https://www.alexji.com/">Alexander P. Ji</a>, and Dr.
<a href="https://www.anichiti.space/">Anirudh Chiti</a> on using 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photometry_(astronomy)#:~:text=Photometry%2C%20from%20Greek%20photo%2D%20(,light%20radiated%20by%20astronomical%20objects.">photometry</a>
to identify member stars of three of the MW UFDs: 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo%C3%B6tes_I">Boötes I</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo%C3%B6tes_II">Boötes II</a>, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segue_1">Segue I</a>. Traditionally, observers use 
<a href="https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/spectra1.html#:~:text=The%20science%20of%20spectroscopy%20is,fast%20the%20material%20is%20moving.">spectroscopy</a> to identify member stars from their radial velocities and metallicities, but a big issue with spectroscopy is that it primarily focuses on the 
central region of the system. Since spectroscopy is extremely time-consuming and expensive, observers tend to apply spectroscopy only to targets which 
they can be sure to yield significant results, and the center is a good place to look at because this region has a higher density of member stars. This makes
the outer region of UFDs unexplored. However, intriguing signatures that give information about the evolution history of UFDs, such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_disruption_event">tidal disruption</a>, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_merger">merger events</a>, and <a href="https://astrobites.org/2017/04/12/breaking-wind/">supernova feedback</a> all lie on the outskirts of UFDs. How to solve this problem and access information on the outer region of UFDs? We turn to photometry for help!


We use the Dark Energy Survey Camera (<a href="https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/the-des-project/instrument/the-camera/">DECam</a>)'s _u_-band to calculate 
photometric metallicity of each star in the camera's FOV. This works because the _u_-band covers the prominent 
<a href="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2018/03/aa31926-17/aa31926-17.html#:~:text=The%20resonance%20doublet%20of%20Ca,investigate%20the%20photosphere%20and%20chromosphere.">Ca II K</a>
 metal absorption line and can
thus be used to relate _u_-band brightness to metallicity. We then apply an isochrone cut, proper motion cut, and photometric metallicity cut to select member stars of each UFD. We plotted out the spatial distribution of these member stars, and found that Boötes I is possibly undergoing tidal disruption
by the MW host, Boötes II has a much more isotropic distribution of member stars but needs follow-up spectroscopy to confirm, and Segue I
is possibly also undergoing tidal disruption. Moreover, we found new member stars of Segue I out to 5-6 half-light radii of the system. Paper forthcoming. Stay tuned!


How does stochastic star formation affect global properties of dwarf galaxies?
---
For my honors thesis, I worked with Prof. <a href="https://astro.uchicago.edu/~andrey/">Andrey Kravtsov</a> on improving a semi-analytical galaxy evolution
model called <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.2667K/abstract">GRUMPY</a>
(credit to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grumpy_Cat">GRUMPY cat</a>, don't ask me why they named it that) by implementing stochastic star formation in dwarf galaxies in the model. The dwarf galaxies that the model produces exhibit properties that align with observations, but one issue is that there is no faint, blue dwarf galaxies in the model, but they exist in observations such as SAGA and ELVES.
